# Visual Diary
An image centric WordPress theme.

You can see it in action [here](https://marcellocurto.com).

Supports infinite scroll and is ready for MacOS dark mode.

This is the main view to scroll through large sized images without much distraction.

And this is how it looks in dark mode.

The theme also works for text based posts.

![](/img/quotes-light)

And looks great in dark, too.

![](/img/quotes-dark)

Each image/post has it's indiviual page where each can have individually colored backgrounds.

They can be solid in color.

![](/img/color)

Or have a color gradient.

There is also a grid archive view to quickly browse a large collection of images.

![](/img/grid)

The theme switches to dark mode automatically when the user's device does.
